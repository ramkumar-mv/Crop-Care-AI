# Crop Care AI - Frontend

## Abstract

In India, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy, being the second largest producer of wheat and rice. It employs 60% of the population and generates 17% of the total GDP. This project focuses on the **frontend** of an innovative **Crop Care AI solution** for precision agriculture.

The system utilizes **ground sensors** to collect real-time data on **NPK levels**, **pH**, and **rainfall**. This data is analyzed by machine learning algorithms to provide crop recommendations and optimal fertilizer quantities. The **frontend** component of this project is a **mobile application** that allows users to access these recommendations and insights, regardless of their location or expertise.
